Today in awesome ideas that we never, ever want to see happen in real life: an augmented reality app that makes it look like a titan is attacking your town.

Augmented-reality technology is used for a wide range of marketing apps, educational toys, and games. Its most common use is to create a 3D image that shows up on a real-world background when you view it through your phone screen or computer. For example, one of our favorites is Tokyo's Sunshine Aquarium penguin app, which makes it look like penguins are walking in front of you on the street.


This fanmade Attack on Titan augmented-reality app does something similar for the Colossal Titan, using a visual marker that tells a camera when to project a 3D model of the titan onscreen. Oh yeah, and the titan can dance.

As YouTube user kamoc explains in this video, the bigger the marker, the bigger the titan. So he set out to create the biggest marker grid he could, attaching it to the ground outside. Then he flew a drone overhead with a camera, and the Colossal Titan appeared as soon as the camera was at the right angle to pick up the marker image.
