Strategy & Partners announced on Thursday that both the Puella Magi Madoka Magica Online and Shingeki no Kyojin -Hangeki no Tsubasa- Online (Attack on Titan: The Wings of Counterattack Online) browser games will end service on May 28.

Puella Magi Madoka Magica Online launched in August 2012. While the game is free to play, items cost money. The player can make friends with magical girls and form a party of six, including the player's own character. As an online title, the game also supports cooperative play between multiple players as they take on Walpurgis Night.

The Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) online game launched in November 2011. In the game, players are able to strengthen their weapons using a “craft” feature and fight Titans using the “Titan Fight” feature.

Separately, Sega announced on Nintendo's Miiverse on Thursday that the Initial D Perfect Shift Online Nintendo 3DS game will end service on June 30 at 8:00 p.m.

Sega launched the racing game last April as a free digital download with in-game purchases.
