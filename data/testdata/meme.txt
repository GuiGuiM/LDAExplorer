About
Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin ; lit. “Advancing Giants”) is a manga series first created by Japanese author Hajime Isayama and an anime series produced by anime studio Production I.G. Set in a post-apocalyptic, medieval fortified society from an alternate history, the story follows Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and their friend Armin Arlert, who all enlist in the military to join the humanity’s epic battle for survival against a race of gigantic, destructive humanoids known as the Titans.
History
In an interview with the Nihon TV program Zip![22], Isayama said that the idea for the Titans came from an encounter he had with a drunk customer while working at an internet cafe. Unable to understand or communicate with him, Isayama said he was inspired by his utter inability to communicate with a fellow human who spoke the same language, leading him to conclude that “the most familiar and scary in the world is actually the humanity.”
In September 2009, the original manga series ran on the Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine and later published as a standalone book on March 17th, 2010. The popularity of the series soon paved the way for an anime series adaptation to be produced by Production I.G and directed by Tetsurō Araki, who is most well known for his work on series such as High School of the Dead and Death Note. The anime mini-series premiered on April 6th, 2013 and the finale episode aired on September 28th, 2013. In addition to the manga and anime series, a live-action film adaptation has been announced, with no release date disclosed as of yet, as well as several visual novels for PlayStation 3.
Online Relevance
Since the airing of the anime series, Attack on Titan has garnered an international following on the web and a particularly strong presence on English-speaking communities like Tumblr[1], Reddit[2], 4chan’s /a/ Anime and Manga board[3], DeviantART[10], Fanpop[4], My Anime List[5] and FanFiction.net[6]. In addition, there are a number of referential hubsites about the series, such as the Shigeki no Kyojin wiki[7], TV Tropes[8] and Anime News Network.[9]
Sink Fandom on Tumblr
In early July 2013, Tumblr users began sharing stock photographs of sinks under the tag “sink fandom,”[19] a tongue-in-cheek fandom born out of confusing “SNK,” which is the English initialism for the original series title “Shingeki No Kyojin,” with “sinks.” On July 19th, the single topic blog Fuck Yeah Sink Fandom[18] was launched. On July 20th, Tumblr users SlipperyDipper[15] and Whovian9and34[16] posted compilations of sink images, gaining more than 49,000 likes and 56,000 likes within the first week.
